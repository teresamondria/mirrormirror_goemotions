User: I just consumed content about **{topic}** that felt very **{tone}** in its emotional tone.
Give me 3 alternative articles or videos on the same topic **{topic}** that offer a more balanced or different emotional perspective (for example, if the original was very {tone}, include sources that are more neutral or opposite in tone).
For each recommendation, provide the title, a brief note on its tone/perspective, and a URL.
Ensure the recommendations are from credible sources and have a contrasting or neutral tone relative to the original content.`;
